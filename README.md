# Celebrity Face Classification 

## Overview
This project involves creating a celebrity face classification model using OpenCV for image processing, and Flask for the backend server. The application allows users to input an image via a user interface, and the model will identify the celebrity in the image.

## Features
- **Face Detection**: Utilizes OpenCV to detect and crop faces from input images.
- **Celebrity Classification**: A machine learning model trained to recognize and classify celebrity faces.
- **Flask Backend**: Handles image processing and prediction requests.
- **User Interface**: Simple web interface for users to upload images and view results.

## Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Flask
- OpenCV


## Usage
1. **Upload an Image**: On the web interface, use the upload button to select an image from your computer.
2. **Submit for Prediction**: Click the submit button to send the image to the server for processing.
3. **View Results**: The predicted celebrity name will be displayed on the interface.
